<h1>MUSHROOMS OF AMERICA, EDIBLE AND POISONOUS.</h1>

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>These charts are prepared for popular use, rather than for students of
botanical science; all technical terms are, therefore, as far as
possible, avoided.</p>

<p>The names "mushroom" and "toadstool" are indefinite, are both applied
with equal reason to any fleshy fungus, and are here used as
synonymes, like the corresponding term "plant" and "vegetable," or
"shrub" and "bush," in common conversation.</p>

<p>No general test can be given by which a poisonous mushroom may be
distinguished from an edible mushroom. But each species of fungus has
certain marks of identity, either in appearance, quality, or condition
of growth, which are its own, and never radically varied; none can
contain a <i>venomous</i> element at one time, and yet be harmless under
other conditions. Like other food, animal or vegetable, however,
mushrooms may, by decay or conditions of growth, be unfit for table
use; yet in this state no <i>fatality</i> would attend such use.</p>

<p>Therefore the identification of species is a safe guide, and is the
only means of knowing what mushrooms should be eaten, and what
varieties of fungus should be rejected. Having once learned to
distinguish any species of mushrooms as esculent, perfect security may
be felt in the use of that species wherever and whenever found; but
any specimen varying from the type in the slightest degree should be
rejected by an amateur.</p>

<p>There are about one thousand varieties of mushrooms (exclusive of
small or microscopic fungi) native to the United States; many will
therefore be found which are not represented on either of these
plates. Those here depicted are of three classes, namely, the
Lycoperdaceæ, or Puff-ball fungi; the Agaricini, or Gill-bearing
fungi; and the Boleti, which last is one division of the Polyporei, or
Pore-bearing fungi.</p>

<p>The following definitions are here given, and will be found
necessary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p class="hang"><b><i>PILEUS.</i></b> The expanded disk or cap of the mushroom or toadstool.</p>

<p class="hang"><b><i>GILLS.</i></b> The thin plates set on their edges under the pileus,
running to a common centre at the stem.</p>

<p class="hang"><b><i>TUBES.</i></b> The spongy collection of pores which take the place of
gills under the pileus of a Boletus.</p>

<p class="hang"><b><i>VEIL.</i></b> A web or membrane which extends from the margin of the
pileus to the stem when the mushroom is young, and thus encloses
the gills.</p>

<p class="hang"><b><i>RING.</i></b> A part of the veil adherent to the stem, and forming a
collar around it.</p>

<p class="hang"><b><i>VOLVA.</i></b> The sheath or wrapper enclosing the young mushroom, when
below or just above the ground; the remains of which are found in
the ring, the veil, at the base of the stem, and in the warty or
scurfy top of some varieties of mushrooms.</p>

<p class="hang"><b><i>SPORES.</i></b> The reproductive bodies, analogous to seeds in some other
plants, found under the caps of the Agaricini and Boleti, and
appearing like fine dust when the cap is left for a time lying
under-side downward.</p><br /></div>

<p>There are as many different flavors and tastes among esculent fungi as
are found in any other varieties of diet, and the very general
ignorance of this fact is a sufficient reason for the issue of this
work. Many persons claim to know a mushroom from a toadstool. This
means that there is one variety out of a thousand of which they eat
with safety, and it means nothing more. A person might as well select
one fish from the sea, and avoid all other members of the finny tribe
on the ground that there are poisonous fishes. It is strange that this
general ignorance is most apparent in the case of the English-speaking
people. The fungus eaters form a little clique in England, but the
majority of her people know nothing of this gratuitous offering from
Nature's storehouse. No country is richer in mushroom food than
America. Were the poorer classes of Russia, Germany, Italy, or France
to see our forests during the autumn rains, they would feast on the
rich food there going to waste. For this harvest is spontaneous; it
requires no seed-time, and asks for no peasant's toil. At the same
time, the economic value of mushroom diet ranks second to meat alone.
With bread, and mushrooms properly gathered and prepared, a person may
neglect the butcher during the summer months. This is self-evident to
the unscientific mind by the simple facts that mushrooms make the same
use of the air we breathe as is made by animals, that cooked they
resemble no form of vegetable food, and that in decay their odor in
some cases cannot be distinguished from that of putrid meat. To this
feast, abundantly provided by Nature for the poorest as well as the
most epicurean, we invite the American people.</p>

<p>In gathering mushrooms for food, cut the stem off about an inch below
the cap, and place them in the basket or dish, gills upward. Never
twist or pull them, as the gills become thereby full of dirt, which is
not easily removed. By placing them gills downward, they will shed
their spores largely and thus lose flavor.</p>

<p>The stem in cutting will often exhibit fine holes; this indicates that
maggots have entered the mushroom. If the substance of the pileus
continues firm and hard, the mushroom may be cooked and eaten by those
not over-nice; but if perforated and soft, the consequent
decomposition might induce nausea, and even serious sickness.</p>

<p>Mushrooms may be noxious as food in three ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) They may disagree with the system, by their toughness,
indigestibility, or use in a state of decay.</p>

<p>(2.) They may be slimy, acrid, or otherwise nauseous.</p>

<p>(3.) They may contain a subtle poison without taste, smell, or other
indication of its presence.</p>

<p>Most noxious fungi appertain to the first or second class above given,
and taste or common-sense would readily reject them, unless they were
cooked with other food or excessively spiced. For this reason plain
cooking is advised, and further, no amateur should venture to mingle
with good varieties others to him unknown.</p>

<p>Of the third class, there is one family, many of whose members contain
a violent and deadly poison. This is known as the <i>Amanita</i> family;
and although out of fourteen varieties, four are known to be edible,
yet it is here advised to avoid all fungi as food which have these its
distinguishing marks:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) A scurfy or warty top, the protuberances of which rub easily off,
leaving the skin intact. In a number of specimens many will be found
entirely smooth, while near them are others of the same variety where
more or less of the specks remain.</p>

<p>(2.) A ring; generally large and reflexed or falling downward.</p>

<p>(3.) A volva; more or less enclosing the young plant, and remaining at
the base of the older specimen, so that when the mushroom is pulled up
a socket is left in the ground.</p>

<p>These three marks should all exist in the typical plant of this
family, and the experienced eye will see signs of their presence, even
where they are wanting. But the <i>volva</i> rarely or never decays during
the life of the specimen, and to reject everything with this mark is
recommended to all amateurs.</p>

<p>So far as known, there are no cases of death by the use of mushrooms
except from this one family. In all well-defined cases of fatal
poisoning, the cause is just as well defined, namely, the use of the
mushroom represented by Plates <a href="#Plate_IX">IX.</a> and <a href="#Plate_X">X.</a> in this sheet. Therefore,
when one has become perfectly acquainted with this family, and learned
to always reject them, he has very little to fear in the choice of
mushrooms for the table. The poisonous varieties of the Amanita family
are extremely common.</p>

<p>The antidote for this poison is found in the skilful use of the
alkaloids from the family of the Solanaceæ or Nightshades, especially
in subcutaneous injections of Atropine. But to the public generally,
in cases of poisoning, no other advice can be given than to call a
physician without delay.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a> represents several members of the Russula family. Having
once learned to identify it without danger of error, this family is
quite safe for use as food; for all the non-esculent Russulas are hot
or nauseous to the taste, while the edible ones are very nutty and
pleasant. The student should, therefore, taste each specimen when
preparing them for cooking.</p>

<p>Some authorities consider all Boleti fit for table use, but there are
those which are too bitter for food, and one such as the specimen
numbered <a href="#Plate_XI_1">1, Plate XI.</a>, would spoil a whole stew. The tubes of this
Boletus (<i>felleus</i>) are light rose, although they appear to be white
when fresh and young. A good rule for amateurs is to avoid all the
lurid Boleti; by this is meant all those that have the slightest shade
of red to the tubes, although I have often eaten of such. The
mild-colored members of this family, having white, yellow, or greenish
tubes, if pleasant to the taste, may be considered safe eating.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> represents some of the esculent puff-balls. There are some
warty fungi growing on wood, which, in early growth, resemble
puff-balls, whose qualities are not yet known. But all those varieties
of clear white fungi, which appear in little balls on the open ground
after rains, may be eaten with perfect safety, if fresh, white inside,
and hard; if soft and yellowish, or black in the pulp, they should be
avoided, as they are approaching decay.</p>

<p>The most important advice to the student is to learn to recognize the
Amanita family, and to avoid them all; next, to define and recognize
any mushroom he is using for food, so that he could pick a single
specimen of the same out of a basketful of assorted fungi; and
finally, never to pick mushrooms at random for food, unless he has
tested by actual use each and all of the varieties so used. There is a
large family of mushrooms resembling the Russulas, which exude a milky
juice if broken or cut. The amateur will do well to avoid all such,
although they are esculent where the milk is mild to the taste.
Additional plates, displaying other varieties of esculent mushrooms,
may possibly be issued in the future.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>DESCRIPTION.</b> <span class="smcap">Pileus.</span> Dry, silky or downy from the first; globular,
margin united to the stem by the veil, then expanded, bell-shaped,
at last even flat. Color variable, from white to dark brown.
Cuticle easily separable in pasture variety.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Gills.</span> At first pink, then purple, finally almost black, never
white; of different lengths.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Stem.</span> Nearly solid, even in size, easily removed from the socket.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Volva.</span> None; but veil present, at first enclosing gills, then
making a ring, finally absent.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Spores.</span> Purple or purplish brown. <span class="smcap">Taste</span> and <span class="smcap">smell</span> fragrant and
agreeable.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Grows</span> in open pastures, lanes or roadsides; never in forests.</p>

<p class="hang">(B.) Similar to above, but coarser, more brittle and of stronger
flavor; turns rust of iron color when bruised; grows on banks,
street-sweepings and in hot-houses.</p></div>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> Stew in milk or cream; prepare to serve with meat as
described under <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a>, or broil as directed under <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a></p>

<p><b>TO ROAST IN THE OVEN.</b> Cut the larger specimens into fine pieces, and
place them in a small dish, with salt, pepper and butter to taste; put
in about two tablespoonfuls of water, then fill the dish with the
half-open specimens and the buttons; cover tightly and place in the
oven, which must not be overheated, for about twenty minutes. The
juice of the larger mushrooms will keep them moist, and, if fresh,
yield further a most abundant gravy.</p>

<p>N. B. In gathering the pasture variety, cut them just below the cap
(<i>don't pull them</i>); they can then be cooked without washing or
peeling. The cultivated mushrooms are often so dirty as to require
both washing and peeling.</p>

<div class="block"><p class="hang"><b>DESCRIPTION.</b> <span class="smcap">Pileus.</span> At first oval and hard; margin then
separating from the stem; then equally cylindrical, margin turning
black; finally expanded, and decaying by dissolution into inky
fluid. Color of pileus variable from brown to pure white, always
woolly, shaggy, the cuticle coming off in layers like the scales
of a fish.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Gills.</span> At first white, crowded; possibly pink, then dark purple,
or black, and moist.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Stem.</span> Thick at base, equal above ground, hollow, appearing like
macaroni cooked.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Volva.</span> None, but ring present, and movable in the full-grown
specimen.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Spores.</span> Black. <span class="smcap">Smell</span> strong, especially at centre of pileus.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Taste.</span> Pleasant raw, but should not be eaten after it is moist and
black.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Grows</span> in rich lawns, roadsides, or newly filled city grounds, in
groups or solitary.</p></div>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> For about twenty mushrooms, put into a saucepan one gill of
milk or cream, add salt and pepper to the taste, with a piece of
butter the size of the larger specimens above; when it boils, put in
the stems and small hard mushrooms; after ten minutes' boiling add the
larger specimens; keep the dish covered and boiling for ten minutes
longer, then pour the stew over dry toast, and serve.</p>

<p><b>TO SERVE WITH MEAT.</b> Chop the mushrooms fine, let them simmer ten
minutes in one half gill of water, with butter, salt and pepper as for
oyster sauce; thicken with flour or ground rice; pour over the meat
and cover quickly.</p>

<p>N. B. But very little fluid is needed in cooking this mushroom, as it
yields a rich juice of its own. It should always be cleaned before
cooking, by scraping it smooth and until it is perfectly white.</p>

<div class="block"><p class="hang"><b>DESCRIPTION.</b> <span class="smcap">Pileus.</span> Leathery, tough, and of an equal cream color,
pliable when moist; shrivelling, wrinkled, even brittle when dry,
changing from the former to the latter with a dew or rain followed
by a hot sun, and also <i>vice versa</i>. Cuticle not separable.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Gills.</span> Broad, wide apart, of the same color as pileus, or a little
paler.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Stem.</span> Solid, of equal circumference; tough, not breaking easily if
bent or twisted.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Volva</span> and ring, none.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Grows</span> in rings or groups in rich lawns or roadsides.</p></div>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> For serving with meat or fish, cut the tops clear from the
stems just below the gills. To a pint of mushrooms, if moist, add
about a gill of water, pepper and salt to the taste, and a piece of
butter half the size of an egg. Simmer together over the fire ten or
fifteen minutes, thicken with flour or ground rice, and pour over the
cooked meat or fish.</p>

<p><b>TO BROIL.</b> Place the tops like oysters on a fine wire gridiron; as soon
as they are hot, butter them lightly, and salt and pepper to the
taste. Put them back over the coals, and when they are heated through
they are cooked. Butter them, if required, and place in a hot dish.</p>

<p>N. B. When the mushrooms are dried, swell them in water before
cooking.</p>

<span class="link"><a href="images/x-plate-04.jpg">View larger image</a></span></div>

<div class="block"><p class="hang"><b>DESCRIPTION.</b> <span class="smcap">Pileus.</span> Pure white, dry at first, nearly globular,
then bell-shaped, finally expanded and becoming darker, even smoky
in color. In early growth very brittle, cuticle always peeling
easily.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Gills.</span> At first pure white, then pinkish, finally rusty; withered
in color and texture; always turning pink or dark if exposed to
dry heat.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Stem.</span> Hollow, bulbous at base in small specimens, then elongated
and equal; leaves the socket easily, without breaking into the
gills.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Volva.</span> None; veil distinct and entire, enclosing the gills at
first, then ruptured, forming the ring.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Spores.</span> Pale pink or rosy. <span class="smcap">Taste</span>, mild, agreeable, but insipid.
<span class="smcap">Odor</span>, none. Grows in lawns and richly cultivated grass plots;
rarely or never in forests.</p></div>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> This mushroom, while sweet and of firm body, has little or no
flavor of its own. It may, therefore, be best to stew it as directed
under <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, with milk, or under <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a>, with water; in either
case mixing some proportion of either or all of the three preceding
kinds. In such case, it will completely absorb their flavor. For those
who like spices it is very nice cooked as number three for meat or
fish, adding to that receipt chopped parsley, an onion, or a clove of
garlic, chopped fine, with a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce. If
served with any meat making an abundant gravy, cook as directed under
the plate of Edible Russulas.</p>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> Stew in milk or cream as directed under <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a>, except
that this mushroom is dry and firm, and more liquid may be used, for
it will make little or no gravy of its own. It is not of suitable
character to be stewed in water, but is very good broiled, requiring
the liberal use of butter, or placed under meat as directed with the
edible Russulas.</p>

<p class="hang">No. 4. <span class="smcap">Boletus sub-tomentosus.</span> Pileus very variable in form, from
bell to cushion shaped; also in color, from light-brown or olive
to any shade of red. Stem touched with red, smooth or with light
lines, often twisted. Flesh and tubes and stem changing to blue
wherever bruised or cut. Tubes yellow, shading at times toward
green. Tastes like walnuts.</p>

<p class="hang">No. 5. <span class="smcap">Boletus chrysenteron.</span> Very similar to No. 4, except that
the pileus is often brick-red. The flesh is sulphur-yellow and
scarcely changeable, and the stem with more red.</p>

<p class="hang">No. 6. <span class="smcap">Boletus strobilaceus.</span> Whole plant blackish, turning red
when bruised or cut, broken into thick fir-cone segments or
scales. Tubes white or rusty, often enclosed by a veil.</p></div>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> Beat up a batter, or simply some fresh eggs, lay the
mushrooms in the same, turning them so as to have the liquid adhere to
them. Then fry in hot boiling fat, or on a buttered griddle, according
to your liking, with salt and pepper to the taste. Broil, bake or
serve under meat as in other recipes here given. Of the above, Nos. 2,
4 and 5 may be stewed, but the others, and, in fact, all Boleti are so
moist or viscous that they are much better cooked by dry heat.</p>

<p>N. B. All the above, and many other varieties of esculent Boleti, have
tubes colored white, gray, green, or yellow; none are even slightly
red.</p>

<p>There are many varieties corresponding in most points with some one of
the three above named, some growing on stumps, but most of them
appearing on sandy soils after heavy rains. None are poisonous.</p>

<p><b>TO COOK.</b> Make a batter, properly seasoned as for frying egg-plant, or
beat up eggs for the same purpose; cut the puff-balls into slices half
an inch thick, and fry in boiling fat or on a buttered griddle.
Puff-balls are also very good stewed with the Coprinus, or with the
ordinary mushroom, as their porous substance absorbs the stronger
flavor.</p>

pure white at every stage of growth. Pileus very variable in color,
from pure white to bright orange or red. All contain a deadly

<div class="block"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figure 1</span> and <span class="smcap">Figure 2</span> above are of a small mushroom which grows in
lawns and pastures, and is very easily mistaken for those on <a href="#Plate_III">Plate
III.</a> of Edible Mushrooms; but, first, they have no point, but are
strictly orbicular; second, the gills are always discolored in age
or decay as in Figure 7 above; third, the texture is soft, and the
mushroom does not dry hard by the sun and re-expand with moisture
as a <i>Marasmius</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figures 3</span> and 4 as also 5 and 6 illustrate species oftenest found
in or on manure, and the above distinctions are equally true of
these two varieties. The above are not known to be assuredly
poisonous, but have none of the esculent qualities of the
fairy-ring champignon. There are also other small fungi of soft
texture and doubtful quality closely resembling these which grow
in lawns and pastures, and the object of this plate is to teach
the amateur to avoid all such. The suspicious varieties of
Marasmius do not grow with the edible species, but in woods.</p></div>
